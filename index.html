            <p>Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist, co-discovered nuclear fission—the process that powers nuclear reactors and bombs. However, her male colleague, Otto Hahn, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1944) while Meitner was ignored. She later became known as the “Mother of the Atomic Bomb”, despite opposing its use.</p>

            <p>Mary Anning, a self-taught paleontologist in the early 1800s, discovered the first complete Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus fossils, shaping the field of paleontology. However, as a working-class woman, she was denied membership in scientific societies, and her work was often credited to male scientists.</p>

            <p>An African American chemist, Percy Julian developed synthetic cortisone, steroids, and birth control hormones from plant sources. His discoveries revolutionized medicine, yet racial barriers kept him from receiving widespread recognition during his lifetime.</p>

            <p>Henrietta Lacks’ cells, taken without her consent in 1951, became the first immortal human cell line (HeLa cells), leading to major medical breakthroughs like the polio vaccine and cancer treatments. Despite her immense contribution to science, she and her family received no recognition or compensation for decades.</p>
